this is a test to see if I can edit stuff properly

also here's plaintext of upgrade ideas/names:

Overclock - upgrade cpu building
firewall - upgrade defensive building
Threat Scan - upgrade defensive turret (building that fights back?)
0-day Exploit - upgrade offensive units

Math problem upgrades:
x*y - multiplication
x/y - division
x^y - exponential

fast thinker - problems give more points for solving them quickly
